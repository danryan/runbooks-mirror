# Overview

**Questions? Contact @pharrison or @shanep

Security is using the [Uptycs](https://www.uptycs.com/) Security Analytics Platform which is based on [osquery](https://osquery.io/).

The osqueryd daemon is rolled out to staging and production by the [gitlab-uptycs cookbook](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-cookbooks/gitlab-uptycs) and is downloading it's configuration profile and sending query results from/to gitlab.uptycs.io which is controlled by the security team.

As osqueryd can consume many system resources - depending on configuration profile and node workload - we added [process_exporter metrics](https://prometheus.gprd.gitlab.net/graph?g0.range_input=30m&g0.expr=rate(namedprocess_namegroup_cpu_user_seconds_total%7Bgroupname%3D%22osqueryd%22%7D%5B5m%5D)&g0.tab=0) for the `osqueryd` process.

See [troubleshooting](../troubleshooting/uptycs_osqueryd.md) for common problems.

## Service Management

The Uptycs service on endpoints runs as `osqueryd` systemd service and is controlled by Chef. You have to set the chef attribute
`"uptycs": {"enable": true}` to start the service on a node - else it will be stopped by the next `chef-client` run.

```
[paul@pharrison-scan-target]~:  sudo service osqueryd status
● osqueryd.service - The osquery Daemon
   Loaded: loaded (/usr/lib/systemd/system/osqueryd.service; enabled; vendor preset: enabled)
   Active: active (running) since Mon 2019-01-28 13:24:07 UTC; 2 weeks 1 days ago
 Main PID: 516 (osqueryd)
    Tasks: 22 (limit: 4915)
   CGroup: /system.slice/osqueryd.service
           ├─  516 /usr/bin/osqueryd --flagfile /etc/osquery/osquery.flags --config_path /etc/osquery/osquery.conf
           └─13316 /usr/bin/osqueryd
```

AS SUCH it can be controlled like any other systemd service:

```
Usage: /etc/init.d/osqueryd {start|stop|status|restart}
```

### Stopping osqueryd

In the event the `osqueryd` service is found to be causing problems it can be disabled using:

```
sudo service osqueryd stop
```

### Starting osqueryd

Similar to stopping the `osqueryd` service, it can be enabled easily using:

```
sudo service osqueryd start
```

### Disable/Enable osqueryd

Disabling `osqueryd` from auto-starting on boot is slightly different:

```
sudo systemctl disable osqueryd
```

Enabling is pretty much the same way:

```
sudo systemctl enable osqueryd
```

### Uninstall osqueryd

The `osqueryd` install/uninstall is managed by the aptitude package manager, and easy to uninstall:

```
sudo apt-get remove osquery
```

If we're looking to remove the config files and ancillary data left by the package:

```
sudo apt-get purge osquery
```

## Updating Uptycs & OSQuery

**WARNING:** Coordinate with Infra before deploying any changes to production as this might temporarily inversely impact the production environment.

Uptycs does offer a way to push updated packages directly to registered assets... but that only works for existing assets and we want new assets to get the same version as deployed across the environment so we should roll updates through Chef.

1. Download the latest `asset package` from the [Uptycs Configuration](https://gitlab.uptycs.io/ui/config) page, selecting the `Ubuntu, Debian` package type and the appropriate asset group (this will likely be `gitlab-production`).  The file will appear as `osquery-<<VERSION>>-Uptycs.deb` making note of the version number for later.  **NOTE:** Download both the `gitlab-staging` and `gitlab-production` packages (making sure to differentiate between the two) so there isn't an Uptycs version bump between staging and production deployment.
1. Upload the packages into the `gitlab-gstg-security\uptycs` and `gitlab-gprd-security\uptycs` buckets in the `gitlab-staging` and `gitlab-production` GCP projects.
1. Submit an MR to the [gstg-base.json](https://ops.gitlab.net/gitlab-cookbooks/chef-repo/blob/master/roles/gstg-base.json), updating the `version` number and sha256 `hash` values to reflect the new package. This will then deploy the updated Uptycs package to GSTG within 30 minutes.
1. Let the new Uptycs version bake for a time period (24hrs?).
1. Assuming there's no issues with tne new Uptycs version, submit an MR to the [gprd-base.json](https://ops.gitlab.net/gitlab-cookbooks/chef-repo/blob/master/roles/gprd-base.json) with the `version` number and sha256 `hash` values similar to the staging information.
1. Monitor in prometheus/production for 24 hours to confirm no issues.

**WARNING**: Once this change is merged _every_ Chef'd host using this cookbook will update Uptycs during the next Chef cycle (30 minutes).

## Failed Update & Rollback

If the new Uptycs version causes issues in grpd or gstg, update the `gstg-base.json` or `gprd-base.json` (based on the deployment phase) back to the previous `version` number and sha256 `hash`.  This will grab and install the previous package from the storage buckets.
