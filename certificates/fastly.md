## Fastly

### Replacement

(Close to) all certificates we use with Fastly are managed by them, too.
Should there be a manually managed certificate, you can follow these steps:

- Obtain the new certificate from [SSMLate](https://sslmate.com/console/orders/).
- *You will not be able to obtain a backup from fastly!*
- Follow https://docs.fastly.com/en/guides/tls-key-and-certificate-replacement
