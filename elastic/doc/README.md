# How-to guides #

## Performing operations on the Elastic cluster ##

One time Elastic operations should be documented as `api_call` s in this repo. Everything else should be managed using CI. 

## Estimating Log Volume and Cluster Size

If we know how much log volume we are indexing per day, how many resources we
are using on our cluster, the desired retention period and how much log volume
we want to add, then we can estimate the needed cluster size.

Currently, fluentd is sending all logs to stackdriver and some logs to GCP
PubSub. We have pubsubbeat nodes for each topic, stending the logs into elastic.

### What is going to Stackdriver?

Stackdriver is ingesting everything - around **50TiB** per month as of 17-01-2020: [Resources

[haproxy logs](https://console.cloud.google.com/monitoring/metrics-explorer?pageState=%7B%22xyChart%22:%7B%22dataSets%22:%5B%7B%22timeSeriesFilter%22:%7B%22filter%22:%22metric.type%3D%5C%22logging.googleapis.com%2Fexports%2Fbyte_count%5C%22%20resource.type%3D%5C%22logging_sink%5C%22%20resource.label.%5C%22name%5C%22%3D%5C%22haproxy_logs%5C%22%22,%22perSeriesAligner%22:%22ALIGN_RATE%22,%22crossSeriesReducer%22:%22REDUCE_NONE%22,%22secondaryCrossSeriesReducer%22:%22REDUCE_NONE%22,%22minAlignmentPeriod%22:%2260s%22,%22groupByFields%22:%5B%5D,%22unitOverride%22:%22By%22%7D,%22targetAxis%22:%22Y1%22,%22plotType%22:%22LINE%22%7D%5D,%22options%22:%7B%22mode%22:%22COLOR%22%7D,%22constantLines%22:%5B%5D,%22timeshiftDuration%22:%220s%22,%22y1Axis%22:%7B%22label%22:%22y1Axis%22,%22scale%22:%22LINEAR%22%7D%7D,%22isAutoRefresh%22:true,%22timeSelection%22:%7B%22timeRange%22:%221w%22%7D%7D&project=gitlab-production)
are send into a GCP sink instead of to pubsub/elastic because of their
size (10MiB/s or **850GiB/day**).

### What is the Volume of our PubSub topics?

[Average daily pubsub volume per topic in GiB](https://thanos-query.ops.gitlab.net/graph?g0.range_input=2w&g0.max_source_resolution=0s&g0.expr=avg_over_time(stackdriver_pubsub_topic_pubsub_googleapis_com_topic_byte_cost%7Benv%3D%22gprd%22%7D%5B1d%5D)*60*24%2F1024%2F1024%2F1024&g0.tab=0)
(base unit in prometheus is Byte/minute for this metric).

[Same metric in Stackdriver metrics explorer](https://console.cloud.google.com/monitoring/metrics-explorer?authuser=1&project=gitlab-production&pageState=%7B%22xyChart%22:%7B%22dataSets%22:%5B%7B%22timeSeriesFilter%22:%7B%22filter%22:%22metric.type%3D%5C%22pubsub.googleapis.com%2Ftopic%2Fbyte_cost%5C%22%20resource.type%3D%5C%22pubsub_topic%5C%22%22,%22perSeriesAligner%22:%22ALIGN_RATE%22,%22crossSeriesReducer%22:%22REDUCE_NONE%22,%22secondaryCrossSeriesReducer%22:%22REDUCE_NONE%22,%22minAlignmentPeriod%22:%2260s%22,%22groupByFields%22:%5B%5D,%22unitOverride%22:%22By%22%7D,%22targetAxis%22:%22Y1%22,%22plotType%22:%22LINE%22%7D%5D,%22options%22:%7B%22mode%22:%22COLOR%22%7D,%22constantLines%22:%5B%5D,%22timeshiftDuration%22:%220s%22,%22y1Axis%22:%7B%22label%22:%22y1Axis%22,%22scale%22:%22LINEAR%22%7D%7D,%22isAutoRefresh%22:true,%22timeSelection%22:%7B%22timeRange%22:%221m%22%7D%7D) (Byte/s)

Total of **1.3TiB/day** as of 17-01-2020 (nginx being excluded).

### How much elastic storage are we using per day?

As we have one index alias per pubsub topic and a naming convention for
rolled-over indices to add the date and a counter, we can grep the elastic cat
api for each pubsub index alias and add together the size of all indices
belonging to the same alias with the same day in the name to get the daily index
volume.  [../api_calls/single/get-index-stats-summary.sh]
is doing that for you.

The results as of 16-01-2020 are analyzed in
[this sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1RN7Ry2pI7iTFURqb0G5zjhNp7xkiPSVG-YsoBOO3TFw).

**We can conclude from this, that index volume (with one replica shard) is around
3 times the volume of the corresponding pubsub topic.**

As of 17-01-2020 we are using ca. **4TiB elastic storage per day** (only pubsub topics, excluding
nginx). That means for a **7 day retention** we consume around 28TiB storage. Adding
nginx logs would increase that by 0.6TiB/day (15%), haproxy logs by 2.5TiB/day (63%).

## Monitoring ##

Because Elastic Cloud is running on infrastructure that we do not manage or have access to, we cannot use our exporters/Prometheus/Thanos/Alertmanager setup. For this reason, the best option is to use Elasticsearch built-in x-pack monitoring that is storing monitoring metrics in Elasticsearch indices. In production environment, it makes sense to use a separate cluster for storing monitoring metrics (if metrics were stored on the same cluster, we wouldn't know the cluster is down because monitoring would be down as well).

When monitoring is enabled and configured to send metrics to another Elastic cluster, it's the receiving clusters' responsibility to handle metrics rotation, i.e. the receiving cluster needs to have retention configured. For more details see: https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/cloud/current/ec-enable-monitoring.html#ec-monitoring-retention  and https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/monitoring-settings.html

## Alerting ##

Since we cannot use our Alertmanager, Elasticsearch Watches have to be used for alerting. They will be configured on the Elastic cluster used for storing monitoring indices.

Blackbox probes cannot provide us with sufficient granularity of state reporting.
