# CI Artifacts CDN

**Table of Contents**

[TOC]

The GitLab CI Artifacts CDN is a Google Application Load Balancer that caches requests made to the Artifacts backend bucket.

## Possible Checks

If it is believed that there is an issue with the Artifacts CDN:

- Check the [Artifacts Storage Overview dashboard](https://dashboards.gitlab.net/d/google-cloud-storage-artifacts-cdn/google-cloud-storage-artifact-cdn-detail?from=now-6h%2Fm&to=now%2Fm&var-PROMETHEUS_DS=Global&var-environment=gprd&var-stage=main&orgId=1)
- Ensure that there is a valid certificate associated with the load balancer, the certificate is Google managed and issued by LetsEncrypt.

Each Artifacts bucket has a sample image that can be used to test that signed URLs are working properly, to generate a signed URL with the gcloud command line:

```
gcloud --project gitlab-production compute sign-url "https://cdn.registry.gitlab-static.net/cdn-test/three-cats.jpg" --key-name gprd-registry-cdn --expires-in 20y --key-file /tmp/gprd-key-file
```

Where `/tmp/gprd-key-file` is the base64 encoded key value that can be read fetched from GKMS secrets (see below).

## Alerting

There are two BlackBox probes for the Staging and Production CDN endpoints:

- <https://cdn.artifacts.staging.gitlab-static.net>
- <https://cdn.artifacts.gitlab-static.net>

If this alert fires, check to be sure the `health` object exists in the bucket `/cdn-test/health`.

This object was copied manually using `gsutil` and is a text file containing the string `OK`:

```
echo OK > /tmp/health
env=gprd
gsutil -h "Content-Type:text/html" cp /tmp/health gs://gitlab-$env-registry/cdn-test/health
```

## Secret Key and Key Rotation

### Overview

The CDN is configured with a secret key that is used by the registry to generate signed URLs. This key is configured in Terraform, and is configured as a Kubernetes secret, sourced from [Vault](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/runbooks/-/blob/master/docs/vault/usage.md#external-secrets-in-kubernetes).

### Rotation

In order to rotate a key, you should first create a new [`random_password`](https://ops.gitlab.net/gitlab-com/gl-infra/config-mgmt/-/blob/05e2b7dbbe1fc46740b16efe9e15802ec26eea01/modules/lb-cdn/main.tf#L1-4) resource, and associate it with a new [`google_compute_backend_bucket_signed_url_key`](https://ops.gitlab.net/gitlab-com/gl-infra/config-mgmt/-/blob/05e2b7dbbe1fc46740b16efe9e15802ec26eea01/modules/lb-cdn/main.tf#L15-20)

**Important**: Do not remove the existing `random_password` and `google_compute_backend_bucket_signed_url_key`, until the new one is in place. No resources should be removed in the first Terraform apply.

After the new key is associated with the CDN:

- Verify the new key by generating a signed URL (see above).
- Wait at least 15 minutes which is the maximum lifetime of signed URLs generated by Artifacts
- Find the base64 encoded `key_value`  by inspecting the Terraform state after applying. The key should be a valid base64 string, decoded it will be a random 16 character password.
- To rotate the key in Vault and creating a new secret version for the application, follow the instructions in the [vault usage doc for rotating secrets](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/runbooks/-/blob/master/docs/vault/usage.md#rotating-kubernetes-secrets).
