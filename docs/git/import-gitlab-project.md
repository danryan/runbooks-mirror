## Custom import

Customers and potential ones may want to import a large project into GitLab.com. Some imports might need our support for various reasons. In such cases, a rake task can be used.

### Deprecation notice

In the past we used a script from runbooks for manually importing projects. The script is kept for reference (will be removed in the future) and is available here: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/runbooks/raw/master/scripts/project_import.rb
