# `pg_xid_wraparound` Saturation Alert

## Risk of DB shutdown in the near future, approaching transaction ID wraparound

This is a critical situation.

This saturation metric measures how close the database is to Transaction ID wraparound.
When wraparound occurs, the database will automatically shutdown to prevent data loss, causing a full outage.
Recovery would require entering single-user mode to run vacuum, taking the site down for a potentially multi-hour maintenance session.

To avoid reaching the db shutdown threshold, consider the following short-term actions:

1. Find and terminate any very old transactions (including those on replicas that have `hot_standby_feedback = on`).  Do this first.  It is the most critical step and may be all that is necessary to let autovacuum do its job.
1. Run a manual vacuum on tables with the oldest `relfrozenxid`.  Manual vacuums run faster than autovacuum because `vacuum_cost_delay = 0` by default, so there it is not throttled.
1. Add autovacuum workers increasing `autovacuum_max_workers` (requires restart) and/or reduce `autovacuum_cost_delay`, if autovacuum is chronically unable to keep up with the transaction rate. Note, too many workers and too low `autovacuum_cost_delay` can saturate resources â€“ first of all, we need to keep an eye on disk IO (read and write throughput, IOPS).

## Finding and terminating very old transactions

Use the following query to find and review long-running transactions. Uncomment the commented line
to terminate all long running transactions once you understand what they are.

```sql
select
  /* pg_terminate_backend(pid) as terminated, */  /* Uncomment this line to kill old transactions */
  now(),
  age(backend_xid) as xid_age,
  now() - xact_start as xid_age_in_wallclock_time,
  *
from
  pg_stat_activity
where
  backend_xid is not null
  and age(backend_xid) > 2^30  /* over half the max age */
order by
  xid_age desc;
```
