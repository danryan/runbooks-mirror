# Adding a PostgreSQL replica

**Table of Contents**

[TOC]

In order to add a PostgreSQL replica to the Patroni cluster, please refer to [patroni-management.md](patroni-management.md).

Other examples here are largely based on taking a basebackup manually.

# Using pg_basebackup to resync a replica

If a replica gets out of sync or fails for some reason, you have several options to recover:

1. Run pg_basebackup from the secondary
2. Use [WAL-G (or older WAL-E)](using-wale-gpg.md) to restore a backup and catch up from
   there
3. Take a disk snapshot of the primary and clone it on the secondary. Be
   sure to [drop replication slots on the secondary after it comes up](postgres.md#replication-slots).

## Running pg_basebackup

All commands are supposed to be run on the replica in question if not
stated otherwise.

`$upstream` is the hostname of the upstream database box we want to use
to resync. This is not necessarily the primary as we can (and should!)
use another secondary for this purpose.

1. Stop PostgreSQL: `gitlab-ctl stop postgresql`
1. Backup `postgresql.auto.conf` for later reference: `cp /var/opt/gitlab/postgreql/data/postgresql.auto.conf /var/opt/gitlab/postgreql/postgresql.auto.conf.$(date +%F)`
1. Remove old data directory `mv /var/opt/gitlab/postgreql/data{,.bak}`
1. Connect to `$upstream` and create physical replication slot on a
   `gitlab-psql` session: `select pg_create_physical_replication_slot($slot)` with `$slot` being a random string you define
1. Start `pg_basebackup` process (preferably in tmux session as this
   takes a while): `sudo -u gitlab-psql PGSSLMODE=disable /opt/gitlab/embedded/bin/pg_basebackup -D /var/opt/gitlab/postgresql/data --slot=$slot -c fast -X stream -P --host=$upstream -p 5432 --username=gitlab-replicator -R`
1. Once finished, review `postgresql.auto.conf` and compare with backup in `/var/opt/gitlab/postgreql/postgresql.auto.conf.$(date +%F)`. Check upstream is `$upstream`.
1. Start PostgreSQL: `gitlab-ctl start postgresql`
1. Let the new replica catch up and become in-sync with `$upstream`.
1. If `$upstream` was a secondary, reconfigure to use the primary and
   also drop the replication slot created in (5) by connecting to `$upstream` and perform a `select pg_drop_replication_slot($slot)` there
1. Persist `postgresql.auto.conf` configuration in Chef using `gitlab-server::postgresql-standby` recipe ([example](https://ops.gitlab.net/gitlab-cookbooks/chef-repo/-/blob/c030986daae6f94c34e367015249c374dd23e55f/roles/gstg-base-db-postgres-replication.json#L5-11)).
1. Make sure to clean up and remove the old data directory in `/var/opt/gitlab/postgreql/data.bak`

After having started PostgreSQL again, there are the following phases:

1. Crash recovery (during this time, the secondary is not accessible: FATAL: the database system is starting up)
1. Catchup with upstream (secondary is accessible but lags behind)

Useful things to look at:

1. `/var/log/gitlab/postgresql/current`
1. `select * from pg_stat_replication` on `$upstream`

Here's an example of a `postgresql.auto.conf` that has both streaming
replication and archive recovery enabled (note `$upstream, $fqdn, $slot`
need to be replaced):

```
primary_conninfo = 'user=gitlab-replicator password=REDACTED host='$upstream' port=5432 fallback_application_name=repmgr sslmode=prefer sslcompression=0 application_name='$fqdn''
recovery_target_timeline = 'latest'
primary_slot_name = $slot

restore_command = '/usr/bin/envdir /etc/wal-g.d/env /opt/wal-g/bin/wal-g wal-fetch -p 32 "%f" "%p"'
```
