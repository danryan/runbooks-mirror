A `lock` in PostgreSQL is a feature that allows transactions to _hold_ something. Usually, that _something_ is a table, an index, or a portion (row/s) of these.

Locks are the way PostgreSQL ensure transactional data consistency, and this is specially handy when concurrent transactions tries to write the same data.

PostgreSQL implements several kinds and layers of locks, and even SELECT statements implements a kind of lock. Locks will execute concurrently, except when one lock conflicts with another.

Below is a comparison of the most commonly used SQL commands that can run concurrently with each other on the same table:

| Runs concurrently with                        | SELECT | INSERT UPDATE DELETE    | CREATE INDEX (CONC) VACUUM ANALYZE | CREATE INDEX | CREATE TRIGGER | ALTER TABLE DROP TABLE TRUNCATE VACUUM (FULL)|
|-----------------------------------------------| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| SELECT                                        | :heavy_check_mark: | :heavy_check_mark: | :heavy_check_mark: | :heavy_check_mark: | :heavy_check_mark: | :x:|
| INSERT UPDATE DELETE                          | :heavy_check_mark: | :heavy_check_mark: | :heavy_check_mark: | :x: | :x: | :x:|
| CREATE INDEX (CONC) VACUUM ANALYZE            | :heavy_check_mark: | :heavy_check_mark: | :x: | :x: | :x: | :x: |
| CREATE INDEX                                  | :heavy_check_mark: | :x: | :x: | :heavy_check_mark: | :x: | :x: |
| CREATE TRIGGER                                | :heavy_check_mark: | :x: | :x: | :x: | :x: | :x: |
| ALTER TABLE DROP TABLE TRUNCATE VACUUM (FULL) | :x:    | :x: | :x: | :x: | :x: | :x: |

And here is a list of locks each statement implements at table and row level:

`SELECT`: ACCESS SHARE LOCK

`INSERT` `UPDATE` `DELETE`: ROW EXCLUSIVE LOCK

`VACUUM`, `ANALYZE`, `CREATE INDEX (conc)`: SHARE UPDATE EXCLUSIVE LOCK

`CREATE INDEX`: SHARE LOCK

`CREATE TRIGGER`, `ALTER TABLE`: SHARE ROW EXCLUSIVE LOCK

`VACUUM FULL`, `REINDEX`, `TRUNCATE`: ACCESS EXCLUSIVE LOCK

### How to see locking and locked activity

When troubleshooting blocked queries, two internal sources of information comes in handy:

The [pg_stat_activity view](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/11/monitoring-stats.html#PG-STAT-ACTIVITY-VIEW), wich gives information about current activity, where is connected from, wich query is executing, and the

[pg_locks system catalog](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/11/view-pg-locks.html), that provides information current locking activity, wich pid it belongs to, if the lock where granted (or is waiting), and so on.

For demostration porpouses, we will create an artificial lock using the [LOCK](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/11/sql-lock.html) command:

Session :one: will issue a LOCK statement (wich implement a ACCESS EXCLUSIVE lock, wich conflicts even with SELECT operations:

```SQL
locktest=# begin;
BEGIN
locktest=# lock TABLE mytable ;
LOCK TABLE

```

Then session :two: try to access the same data:

```sql

locktest=# select count(*) from mytable;

```

That SELECT will wait until LOCK is released.  OK, how can we tell what is blocking what? We can use this snippet posted by Nikolay Samokhvalov, that combines the information from `pg_stat_activity` and `pg_locks`:

```sql
with recursive l as (
  select
    pid, locktype, granted,
    array_position(array['AccessShare','RowShare','RowExclusive','ShareUpdateExclusive','Share','ShareRowExclusive','Exclusive','AccessExclusive'], left(mode, -4)) m,
    row(locktype, database, relation, page, tuple, virtualxid, transactionid, classid, objid, objsubid) obj
  from pg_locks
), pairs as (
  select w.pid waiter, l.pid locker, l.obj, l.m
  from l w join l on l.obj is not distinct from w.obj and l.locktype = w.locktype and not l.pid = w.pid and l.granted
  where not w.granted
  and not exists (select from l i where i.pid=l.pid and i.locktype = l.locktype and i.obj is not distinct from l.obj and i.m > l.m)
), leads as (
  select o.locker, 1::int lvl, count(*) q, array[locker] track, false as cycle
  from pairs o
  group by o.locker
  union all
  select i.locker, leads.lvl + 1, (select count(*) from pairs q where q.locker = i.locker), leads.track || i.locker, i.locker = any(leads.track)
  from pairs i, leads
  where i.waiter=leads.locker and not cycle
), tree as (
  select locker pid,locker dad,locker root,case when cycle then track end dl, null::record obj,0 lvl, locker::text path, array_agg(locker) over () all_pids
  from leads o
  where
    (cycle and not exists (select from leads i where i.locker=any(o.track) and (i.lvl>o.lvl or i.q<o.q)))
    or (not cycle and not exists (select from pairs where waiter=o.locker) and not exists (select from leads i where i.locker=o.locker and i.lvl>o.lvl))
  union all
  select w.waiter pid,tree.pid,tree.root,case when w.waiter=any(tree.dl) then tree.dl end,w.obj,tree.lvl+1,tree.path||'.'||w.waiter,all_pids || array_agg(w.waiter) over ()
  from tree
  join pairs w on tree.pid=w.locker and not w.waiter = any (all_pids)
)
select (clock_timestamp() - a.xact_start)::interval(0) as transaction_age,
  (clock_timestamp() - a.state_change)::interval(0) as change_age,
  a.datname,
  a.usename,
  a.client_addr,
  tree.pid,
  a.wait_event_type,
  a.wait_event,
  pg_blocking_pids(tree.pid) blocked_by_pids,
  replace(a.state, 'idle in transaction', 'idletx') state,
  lvl,
  (select count(*) from tree p where p.path ~ ('^'||tree.path) and not p.path=tree.path) blocking_others,
  case when tree.pid=any(tree.dl) then '!>' else repeat(' .', lvl) end||' '||trim(left(regexp_replace(a.query, e'\\s+', ' ', 'g'),300)) latest_query_in_tx
from tree
left join pairs w on w.waiter = tree.pid and w.locker = tree.dad
join pg_stat_activity a using (pid)
join pg_stat_activity r on r.pid=tree.root
order by (now() - r.xact_start), path

```

This will show a complete _tree_ of blocking and blocked queries:

```
 transaction_age | change_age | datname  | usename  | client_addr |  pid  | wait_event_type | wait_event | blocked_by_pids | state  | lvl | blocking_others |        latest_query_in_tx
-----------------+------------+----------+----------+-------------+-------+-----------------+------------+-----------------+--------+-----+-----------------+----------------------------------
 00:10:25        | 00:10:18   | locktest | postgres | 127.0.0.1   | 20252 | Client          | ClientRead | {}              | idletx |   0 |               1 |  lock TABLE mytable ;
 00:09:14        | 00:09:14   | locktest | postgres | 127.0.0.1   | 20594 | Lock            | relation   | {20252}         | active |   1 |               0 |  . select count(*) from mytable;
(2 rows)



```

Here, the _root_ of the blocking chain can be identified with a 0 (zero) in the ```lvl``` column.

In practice, you will probably add a `\watch 2` in _gitlab-psql_ session, for automatically repeat and refresh the screen.

## How to cancel (or terminate) a blocking query

If you decided to cancel the blocking query, you only need to take that from the `pid` column and execute a

```sql
select pg_cancel_backend(<pid>);
```

or

```sql
select pg_terminate_backend(<pid>);
```

Both functions will return `true` or `false`, meaning that operation was succesfully achieved (or not).

The difference between each of those, is that `pg_cancel_backend()` sends a SIGINT (cancels only the current query, but let's the connection continue to execute queries - idle connections or connections in transaction can't be canceled) and `pg_terminate_backend()` sends a SIGTERM signal (terminating the backend process immediately, also terminating the whole connection). Since terminating any process with SIGTERM can lead to undesired results, you should always try `pg_cancel_backend()` first.

Other options would entail restarting the local Patroni connection to the DB; this would help resetting Postgres TCP state if we believe Postgres is in trouble at the network layer.

A final option, in case pg_cancel_backend or pg_terminate_backend does not terminate the session, would be to execute a kill <pid> from the session that is generating the lock. However this could case instability in the Postgres main process so we could instead think of restarting the Postgres process entirely, for example if the node were out of rotation.

## How to check if queries are waiting to aquire locks from the logs

If [log_lock_waits](https://postgresqlco.nf/en/doc/param/log_lock_waits/11/) is `on`, then every attempt to acquire a lock that has been waiting for more than [deadlock_timeout](https://postgresqlco.nf/en/doc/param/log_lock_waits/11/), a line will be printed to the logfile, similar to:

```
2020-06-26 06:42:37.472 GMT,"gitlab","gitlabhq_production",63330,"10.217.8.4:44814",5ef59793.f762,3,"UPDATE waiting",2020-06-26 06:37:07 GMT,190/102729680,3682318105,LOG,00000,"process 63330 still waiting for ShareLock on transaction 3682318234 after 500
0.126 ms","Process holding the lock: 63387. Wait queue: 41595, 58665, 61792, 63327.",,,,"while rechecking updated tuple (2895868,
6) in relation ""issues""","UPDATE ""issues"" SET ""updated_at"" = '2020-06-26 06:42:31.953247' WHERE ""issues"".""id"" = xxx /*application:sidekiq,correlation_id:xxgG5,jid:26a93d414e53a50996fa909b,job_class:ProcessCommitWorker*/",,,"sidekiq 5
.2.7 queues:pipeline_...ate_highest_role [1 of 5 busy]"

```

depending of the sql being executed.

Similary, locks that took more than to be acquired will also log a message:

```
2020-06-26 07:06:02.604 GMT,"gitlab","gitlabhq_production",92156,"10.217.4.2:49126",5ef59e29.167fc,4,"UPDATE waiting",2020-06-26 07:05:13 GMT,174/111649671,3683276022,LOG,00000,"process 92156 acquired ExclusiveLock on tuple (25979017,1) of relation 33614 of database 16401 after 7463.314 ms",,,,,,"UPDATE ""notes"" SET ...",,,"puma: cluster worker 0: 25811 [gitlab-puma-worker] - 10.220.8.1"
```

That can be tracked down to see if there are queries that have been waiting for too long.

## Deadlocks

A deadlock is a situation where two (or more) processes conflict on their use of resources, each one needing to lock to resource being already locked by the other one, hence blocking each other. PostgreSQL comes with an deadlock detection routine that will kill one of the process involved, allowing the other(s) to progress.
