# walgBaseBackupDelayed

**Table of Contents**

[TOC]

## Overview

- This alert indicates that the `base_backup` for WAL-G has not finished in a certain amount of time.
- This can be due to load on the database servers and network conditions.
- This is not a user impacting alert.
- When this alert fires, it is expected that the recipient of the alert will check in on the `base_backup`, ensure that it is running, and if not try to determine what has interrupted the backup.

## Services

- [Service Overview](../README.md)
- Team that owns the service: [Production Engineering : Database Reliability](https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/infrastructure/core-platform/data_stores/database-reliability/)

## Metrics

- This alert fires if the most recent `base_backup` is older than 30 hours.
- This is recorded via the `gitlab_com:last_walg_successful_basebackup_age_in_hours` recording rule.

## Alert Behavior

- This alert can be silenced if the process is determined to be running and actually working. It shouldn't be silenced for longer than the expected time to finish the backup.
- This alert is expected to be rare.

## Severities

- The severity of this alert is generally going to be a ~severity::4.
- There is no user impact at all. The impact will be in the amount of time it would take to recover should we need to do so.

## Troubleshooting

- Check `/var/log/wal-g/wal-g_backup_push.log` and/or `/var/log/wal-g/wal-g_backup_push.log.1` on patroni nodes. Unfortunately WAL-G logs are not sent to Kibana at this time.
- This will give you information on what is happening. A finished backup will look something like this:

    ```
    <13>Sep  2 00:00:01 backup.sh: INFO: 2021/09/02 08:20:54.669692 Finished writing part 14245.
    <13>Sep  2 00:00:01 backup.sh: INFO: 2021/09/02 08:20:56.337685 Wrote backup with name base_000000050005E38E000000A1
    <13>Sep  2 00:00:01 backup.sh: end backup pgbackup_pg12-patroni-cluster_20210902.
    ```

## Possible Resolutions

- [Another process using CPU causing the backup to slow down](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-infra/production/-/issues/16403)
- [base_backup started on a node that later became unavailable](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-infra/production/-/issues/17710)
- [The generating cluster isn't in production, but still alerting](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-infra/production/-/issues/15918)

## Dependencies

- The `base_backup` requires Google Cloud Storage to be available.
