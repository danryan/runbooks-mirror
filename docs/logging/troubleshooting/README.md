# Troubleshooting

## Overall health (there's something broken with logging but you don't know what)

1. Go to the [Logging Dashboard](https://dashboards.gitlab.net/d/USVj3qHmk/logging?orgId=1&from=now-7d&to=now).
1. If the number of unacked messages is other than 0, than it *most likely* means that everything is fine with infrastructure up to pubsubbeat (fluentd is sending logs, Cloud Pub/Sub is receiving and queueing them, but they are not pulled from the queue by the pubsubbeat).
1. Go to the Elastic monitoring cluster to check the health of the Elastic logging cluster. If the logging cluster is fine than there's probably something wrong with pubsubbeat.

here's an example of how a debugging process might look like:

```mermaid
graph TD
A(Logging Dashboard) -->|Unacked messages > 0| B(gitlab-logs-monitoring cluster)
A --> |Unacked msgs = 0| G(Continue debugging, start with fluentd, Cloud Pub/Sub)
B --> |cluster health green| H(pubsubbeat logs)
B --> |cluster health red| C(more detailed errors)
C -->|shards errors| D(get detailed error msgs for shards from Elastic API)
D --> |nodes running out of disk space| K(release space, retrigger shards allocation)
D --> |failed allocation after 5 attempts| N(retrigger shard allocation)
D --> |reached max number of shards| P(resize cluster or increase number of max shards in the cluster config)
C -->|ILM errors| E(detailed ILM error msg)
E --> |x is not the write index for alias y| O(using the API mark the index as complete)
H --> |errors in logs| I(detailed error msg)
H --> |info msgs only in logs| J(check indexing latency in gitlab-logs-monitoring)
J --> |low latency| L(continue investigating)
J --> |high latency| M(consider resizing elastic cluster or lowering retention)
```

## Fluentd

- monitoring of td-agent  <https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/migration/issues/390>
- check fluentd logs for errors:
  - check `./gitlab-fluentd/attributes/default.rb` for location of the logs
  - ssh to the VM which you suspect to be not sending logs
  - check logs for errors

## PubSub

- monitoring of pubsub <https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/migration/issues/389>
- to ensure that pubsub messages are being consumed and sent to elasticsearch see the [stackdriver pubsub dashboards](https://app.google.stackdriver.com/monitoring/1088234/logging-pubsub-in-gprd?project=gitlab-production)
- check Grafana logging dashboard
  - if the number of unacked messages is going up, it means the problem is with taking messages out of the queue
- check in StackDriver for logs related to: pubsub, pubsub topic, pubsub subscription
- pubsub monitoring graphs in Google console

## pubsubbeat

- check status of the pubsubbeat process:
  - ssh to the pubsub VM which you suspect to be not sending logs
  - check service status: `sv status pubsubbeat`
  - check the process is running, e.g. `ps aux | grep pubsubbeat`
- check logs for errors:
  - check `./gitlab-elk/attributes/default.rb` for location of the logs
  - check logs for errors, most likely available at `/var/log/pubsubbeat/current`
- check cpu usage on the VM

# Failover and Recovery procedures

## Fluentd

## PubSub

### Acknowledge all messages in a queue

Acknowledging all messages currently in the queue is a destructive action (all logs in the queue will be lost!).

`gcloud beta pubsub subscriptions seek <subscription_name> --time=$(date +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%S)`

<https://cloud.google.com/pubsub/docs/replay-overview>

## pubsubbeat

- restart pubsubbeat:
  - `sv status pubsubbeat`   # see how long it's been running
  - `sv restart pubsubbeat`
  - `sv status pubsubbeat`   # see how long it's been running
- stop pubsubbeat:
  - `sv status pubsubbeat`
  - `sv stop pubsubbeat`
  - `sv status pubsubbeat`
  - if it's still running:
    - it might actually still be shutting down gracefully, for example waiting until all uploads to ES are finished, check logs
    - if it's not doing anything or you absolutely have to kill it now: `kill -9 <pubsubbeat_pid>` PLEASE BE SUPER CAREFUL WITH THIS COMMAND AND ONLY USE IF YOU HAVE NO OTHER CHOICE!
