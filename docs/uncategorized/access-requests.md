## Ops Instance Access

Generally when developers ask for access to the ops instance, we are concerned
with chatops access, which requires developer on `gitlab-com` group.
If access to any other groups are needed, please clarify with the requester.

## Read Only Rails Console Access

When developers ask for access to the rails console, have them submit an access request via Teleport using the [Teleport Rails Console Runbook](../teleport/Connect_to_Rails_Console_via_Teleport.md) - Then approve that request (if appropriate) using the [Teleport Approval Workflow](../teleport/teleport_approval_workflow.md) - If the request is for Read/Write access, it's best to give the commands to an SRE and have them run them.
