# Uploads

## Intro

Search keywords: attachments, files

Uploads in production are stored in a GCS bucket: <https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/administration/uploads.html#object-storage-settings>

Here's an example of an upload URL: `https://gitlab.com/<full/project/path>/uploads/<secret>/image.png`

Upload objects in rails are defined here: `./gitlab-ce/app/models/upload.rb`

## Managing uploads (deleting, renaming, etc)

At the moment of writing there is no UI for managing uploads: <https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce/issues/23553>

Using the console, you can find the upload object in the rails application:

```ruby
upload = Upload.find_by_secret('<secret>')
```

**NOTE**: This operation will likely time out in production since its search scope is the entirety of the user uploads table.

Do this instead:

```rb
full_path = 'full/project/path'
project = Project.find_by_full_path(full_path) || Group.find_by_full_path(full_path)
```

And now that the search scope has been narrowed down to a single project:

```rb
upload = project.uploads.find_by_secret('<secret>')
upload.path
```

its path in GCS (the storage path consists of two hashes: storage hash and upload's secret):

```ruby
upload.path
```

and delete the upload together with the file on GCS:

```ruby
upload.destroy
```

or rename it:

```ruby
> upload.secret = "<new GUID>"
> upload.path  # this path consists of a hash and the upload's secret, it will be used in the next command
> upload.path = "<path from previous command with upload's secret replaced with the newly generated secret>"
> upload.save!
# move file in object storage manually to new path
```

## Example

URL of an upload that needs to be removed: <https://gitlab.com/4dface/4dface-sdk/uploads/f7a123bb72bfa73a2d0cf9c12cab99e1/image.png>

1. Get the upload's path on GCS:

```ruby
> project = Project.find_by_full_path('4dface/4dface-sdk')
> upload = project.uploads.find_by_secret("f7a123bb72bfa73a2d0cf9c12cab99e1")
> upload.path
```

2. Check in GCS that the file is present

3. Remove the file from the rails app and GCS:

```ruby
upload.destroy
```

4. Check again on GCS that the file is gone
