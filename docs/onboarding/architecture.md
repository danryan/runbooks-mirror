# Session: Application architecture

This is a synchronous session that covers the foundational architecture of
GitLab.com.

## Agenda

- [Architecture diagram](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/infrastructure/production/architecture/)
- GCP console overview of VMs
- Life of a request: web ([tutorial](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/www-gitlab-com/-/blob/00d0fb19b0e7d90c32b9c73dc8d0faff86c05117/source/handbook/engineering/infrastructure/tutorials/overview_life_of_a_web_request.html.md))
  - `Cloudflare` => `HAProxy` (routing to webservice api/git/web) => `web: Workhorse` => `web: rails` => Databases (Postgres, Redis, `Gitaly`, GCS)
- Life of a request: git ([tutorial](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/www-gitlab-com/-/blob/9636e8addd6c1130accd4e157991f714f48262aa/source/handbook/engineering/infrastructure/tutorials/overview_life_of_a_git_request.html.md))
  - https: `Cloudflare` => `HAProxy` => `git: Workhorse` (=> `git: rails` for authn) => `Gitaly`
  - ssh: `Cloudflare` => `HAProxy` => `gitlab-shell` (=> `git: rails` for authn) => `Gitaly`
- Exploration of hosts over SSH
  - Looking at running processes, discovering service configuration

  - Application component list with descriptions and links: https://docs.gitlab.com/ce/development/architecture.html#components
- Chef
  - GitLab-specific: Laptop setup, cookbook change workflow, secrets management, one-liners: https://ops.gitlab.net/gitlab-cookbooks/chef-repo#getting-started
  - Generic Chef documentation:
    - Chef Overview (use this as a glossary of Chef vocabulary): https://docs.chef.io/chef_overview/
    - Chef Resource reference (list of built-in resource objects, e.g. `file`, `apt_package`): https://docs.chef.io/resources/
    - Chef Node Attributes (data for use in recipes, provided to chef-client about the current node's present or desired state): https://docs.chef.io/attributes/
- Terraform
  - Note: We are using Terraform version 0.12.x in all GitLab's environments.  The TF docs often mention 0.12 as a major version boundary, and you can ignore caveats about behavior differences older TF versions.
  - GitLab-specific: How to use terraform for managing GitLab.com resources: https://ops.gitlab.net/gitlab-com/gitlab-com-infrastructure/-/blob/master/README.md
  - Video demo of creating staging environment: https://drive.google.com/open?id=0BzamLYNnSQa_cjN5NGtaRnpyRXc
  - Generic Terraform documentation:
    - Terraform CLI and config language docs: https://www.terraform.io/docs/cli-index.html
    - Terraform Glossary: https://www.terraform.io/docs/glossary.html
    - GCP-specific Terraform Provider: https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/google/guides/provider_reference.html
- Runbooks for GitLab.com: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/runbooks/-/tree/master/
  - This git repo contains much more than just "runbooks".
  - It is the main place where we collect internal documentation and advice to ourselves for working with our infrastructure components and services.
  - `/docs` sub-directory contain more up-to-date Runbooks than the root directory in this Repo. 
  - It also composes metrics, alerts, and dashboards for our services using jsonnet.
  - We should probably record a guided tour of this repo.  Or just commit to giving a tour in a pairing session.
