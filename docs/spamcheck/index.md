For gitlab.com we use the external Spam Check endpoint to hook up to a system run by the Security department.

# Configuration

Configured in the `Spam and Anti-bot Protection` section of <https://gitlab.com/admin/application_settings/reporting>.  It can be turned off quickly with the `Enable Spam Check via external API endpoint` checkbox in the event it causes troubles.

Configuration of the rules in the spamcheck service itself is the responsibility of the Security department; as far as gitlab.com is concerned, it is a blackbox service that we interact with via gRPC or web calls, and on-call SREs do not need to concern themselves any further with the implementation under most normal circumstances.

# Verdicts

At this writing, Akismet is also configured, and the GitLab [code base](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/master/app/services/spam/spam_verdict_service.rb#L26) will take the most restrictive (DENY) from both services.  Therefore, an issue being considered spam might be because of Akismet *or* the Security-run service.  This configuration may also change in time; check the [current settings](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-security/runbooks/-/blob/master/automation/spamcheck.md) to be sure.

# Logs

The main GitLab Rails code-base logs the verdict from all sources along with some metadata.  These logs can be most easily located by searching for the [`json.spamcheck` field existing](https://log.gprd.gitlab.net/goto/32d7d91299b21f8ceba48503c51d3c2c).
