#### How to access MacOS VMs?

MacOS VMs are currently hosted in AWS. To gain access, open an individual [Access Request](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/team-member-epics/access-requests/-/issues), to get access to the AWS account:  `saas-mac-runners-b6fd8d28`.

See past [bulk access request](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/team-member-epics/access-requests/-/issues/21531).
