## Fastly

### Replacement

(Close to) all certificates we use with Fastly are managed by them, too.
Should there be a manually managed certificate, you can follow these steps:

* Obtain the new certificate from [SSLMate](https://sslmate.com/console/orders/).
* *You will not be able to obtain a backup from fastly!*
* Follow <https://docs.fastly.com/en/guides/setting-up-tls-with-your-own-certificates>
