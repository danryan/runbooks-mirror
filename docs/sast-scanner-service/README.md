## Summary

The SAST Scanner Service is stateless service that runs SAST scans to provide
SAST in the IDE. This service is currently used by "SAST IDE Integration"
feature, managed by the Secure:Static Analysis team.

The service deployments are being [managed by Runway](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/462808).

The source code repository for the service is available
[here](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/secure/sast-scanner-service) and the
runway deployment configuration is located
[here](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/secure/sast-ide-integration/-/blob/main/.runway/runway.yml?ref_type=heads).
Note, that we use different projects for managing the source code and for
deploying the service.
