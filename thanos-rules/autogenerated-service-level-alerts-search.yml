        Aggregation of all document indexing requests on GitLab.com, as measured from ElasticSearch.

        This alert signifies that the SLI was previously reporting traffic, but is no longer - the signal is absent.

        This could be caused by a change to the metrics used in the SLI, or by the service not receiving traffic.
