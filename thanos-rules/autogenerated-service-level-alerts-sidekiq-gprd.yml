      description: |
        These signifies operations that reach out to a language model with a prompt. These interactions with an AI provider are executed within `Llm::CompletionWorker`-jobs. The worker could execute multiple requests to an AI provider for a single operation.

        A success means that we were able to present the user with a response that is delivered to a client that is subscribed to a websocket. An error could be that the AI-provider is not responding, or is erroring.

        For the apdex, we consider an operation fast enough if we were able to get a complete response from the AI provider within 20 seconds. This not include the time it took for the Sidekiq job to get picked up, or the time it took to deliver the response to the client.

        The `service_class` label on the source metrics tells us which AI related features the operation is for.

        These operations do not go through the API gateway yet, but will in the future.

        This alert signifies that the SLI was previously reporting traffic, but is no longer - the signal is absent.

        This could be caused by a change to the metrics used in the SLI, or by the service not receiving traffic.
