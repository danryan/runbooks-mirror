          title: Scrape errors in Cloudflare exporter
          description: >
            The cloudflare exporter has failed to scrape Cloudflare for 10
            minutes. Note that this refers to a background scrape loop in the
            exporter itself, and that prometheus may be successfully scraping
            the exporter.
