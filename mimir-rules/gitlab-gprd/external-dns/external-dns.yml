          description: |
            ExternalDNS has not synced successfully with Google Cloud DNS in
            cluster {{.labels.cluster}} (region {{.labels.region}}) in the last
            five minutes. This can lead to missing or outdated DNS entries, which
            might lead to service disruption. Check the ExternalDNS logs for more
            information.
