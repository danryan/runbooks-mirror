# Metrics Catalogs

This folder contains definitions used to autogenerate the rules on
`rules/autogenerated-key-metrics.yml`.

# Development

Follow the instructions on
[the dashboards' README.md](../dashboards/README.md#local-development) to
install `jsonnet`.

To update the autogenerated file after you make your changes run
`./scripts/generate-key-metric-recording-rules.sh` from the project's root.

If you're adding a new service catalog make sure to append it to the list on the
`services/all.jsonet` file.
