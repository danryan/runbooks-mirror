  business:
    requirement: |
      In order to correctly point pgbouncer to a DB master after a failover occurs, we needed
      a solution that can do so in an automated fashion. Among different service
      discovery solutions, we chose Consul.
    customers:
      - Internally used by the Patroni cluster to manage leader election and to share common configurations
      - Internally used by WAL-G to do basebackup on one slave node in the Patroni cluster
      - Internally usable by all other infrastructure nodes within a single environment
    business_value: |
      Consul is feature-rich and easy to use. Beside being used by Patroni, it can be used by the Rails application
      to discover healthy DB replicas. Combined with service discovery, its DNS feature is being considered to be
      used in a dedicated pgbouncer cluster instead of the old approach of using Consul watchers.

    requirement: |
      It is required to continuously recover from the WAL archive
      and hence test the WAL archive. This is necessary because PITR
      relies on a continuous sequence of WAL that can be applied to a
      snapshot of the database (basebackup). If that sequence is broken
      for whatever reason, PITR can only recover until this point and no
      further. We monitor the replication lag of the archive replica.
      If it falls back too far, there's likely a problem with the WAL archive.
    customers:
      - Internally used by DBREs
    business_value: |
      Having multiple ways to recover a database is necessary in case one way
      failed for any reason. WAL archiving is one of the ways we can restore
      a database, in addition to disk snapshots and, in the near future, ZFS
      snapshots.

      It is needed to store profiles of GitLab Rails RSpec test suites as executed in our CI pipelines,
      to identify specs with interesting attributes. It is also needed to
      store profiling results from https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gitlab-profiler.
    customers:
      - GitLab.com employees
    business_value: |
      Having profiles for RSpec test suites has advantages like finding the slowest specs,
      or the spec which issues the most queries. Profiling GitLab.com URLs can help identify
      a bottle-nick or a code that's written poorly.

        Services publish their logs to corresponding PubSub topics using fluentd. There is a separate VM for each topic in each environment. Each VM runs a Pubsubbeat process which is subscribed to a topic and uploads messages it receives to ELK.
      architecture: |
        Pub/Sub is a messaging service available on GCP which is similar to RabbitMQ or Kafka. It can be used for many things such as event-driven programming or managing distributed systems. We use it for forwarding logs to ELK. Different components and systems publish their logs to a Pub/Sub topic using fluentd. Pubsubbeat (Elastic Beat capable of subscribing to Pub/Sub topics) forwards them to ELK.
